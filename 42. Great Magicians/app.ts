//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

const magiciannames: string[]=["Harry Houdini","David Blaine","Uri Geller","Chris Angel\n"]

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void 
{
    for(const magician of magicians){
        console.log(magician)
    }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    const graetmagicians: string[] = magicians.map(magician =>`The Great ${magician}`);
    return graetmagicians
}



//Modify the array to add "the graet" to each magicians name
const graetmagiciansname: string[]= make_great(magiciannames)

// call the function to show the great magicians name
console.log('Great Magicians:')
show_magicians(graetmagiciansname)
